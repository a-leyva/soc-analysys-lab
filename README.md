# LEYVASEC SOC Analysis Lab

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains files and documentation for a cybersecurity lab simulating Security Operations Center (SOC) traffic analysis.  
The purpose is to practice **network traffic investigation**, **incident detection**, and **Wireshark analysis**.

---

## 🔍 Lab Objective
- Analyze captured network traffic (PCAP files)  
- Identify suspicious activity, potential intrusions, or unusual communications  
- Document findings with screenshots, notes, and reports
